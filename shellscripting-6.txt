while loop and switch case conditions
-------------------------------------
for while body structure will be 
--------------------------------
initilisation

while ( condition )
do
{ 
----

----
inc/dec
done

echo "while loop demo starts"
i=1

while [ $i -le 5 ]
do
i=`expr $i + 1 `
done 

echo "while loop demo ends"


switch case:
-------------
-->if we want to check the  condition multiplile timea rhen we can use the switch case
-->switch case is the alternative for nested if else condition

example shell script:
---------------------

echo "switch case demo starts"
 case $1 in
start) 
echo "sonar.sh is starting"
echo "sonar.sh is started"
;;
stop)
echo "sonar.sh is stoping"
echo "sonar.sh is stopped"
;;
restart)
echo "sonar.sh is re-starting"
echo "sonar.sh is re-started"
;;
*)
echo "please give the correct argument"
echo "sh $0 start,stop,restart"
esac


-->switch program for num 1 t0 5


echo "switch case print 1 t0 5 num "

read number 

case $number in 

1)
echo "typed number is one "
echo "typed number is correct"
;;
2)
echo "typed number is two "
echo "typed number is correct"
;;
3)
echo "typed number is three "
echo "typed number is correct"
;;
4)
echo "typed number is four "
echo "typed number is correct"
;;
5)
echo "typed number is five "
echo "typed number is correct"
;;
*)
echo "enterd invalid number"

esac

functions:
-----------

we srite n no.of functions and we can call that functions in where ever we want

echo "function demo starts"
function ()
{
echo "my name is sunikl"
echo "we are attending funtions"
}

echo "calling the function"
function
