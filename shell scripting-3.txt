command line arguments
-----------------------
--> while executeing the shell script passing the values is called as command line arguments
--> during shell script execution, values passing through command prompt is called as command line arguments
--> for example while running a shell script, wev can specify the command line arguments as "sh scriptfile.sh arg1 arg2 arg3"

-->"sh scriptfile.sh arg1 arg2 arg3"
-->$0 --> it displsy the shell scriptfile
-->$1 --> it displsy the first arg1
-->$2 --> it displsy the second arg2

--> if we need to define the name as well we use "echo $0" command --it display script file also
--> if the value is more than one we need to keep flower brackets {10}--then it will give 10th argument

--> if we need to find how many arguments are passing for taht ---(echo $#)--it will give the how amny arguments are passing
--> (echo $* and echo $@)---it will give all the  arguments names 


--> differnce between $* and $@

--> $*-- it will give all the args as one string
--> $@-- it will give each arg as one string
--> $$-- it will gives PID of current script
--> $?-- it will gives the  previous CMD execution status--(if the execution is success it will give a 0 value and CMD is not correct it will give a 127 num
--> $#-- it will give the how amny arguments are passing

--> command line argument (example)--25:00 min start in 14th video

operators--
----------
-eq --> == (equl to)
-ne --> != (not equl to)
-le --> <=  (less than or equal to)
-lt --> <  (less than)
-ge --> >= (greater than or equal to)
-gt --> > (greater than)

string:
-------
string is collection of set of characters (or) group of characters enclosed in a single or double quotes.
name="sunil"--> here name is a string variable, and sunil is a assigned value
role="devopsengineer"  -->here role is a string variable, and devopsengineer is a assigned value.

string_var="my name is sunil, i worked in hcl , in hyd location"
here string_var is variable name and "my name is sunil, i worked in hcl , in hyd location" is a assigned value to string_var
--if we need to print that value in console command is 

-->echo $string_var--it will print ( "my name is sunil, i worked in hcl , in hyd location") yhis value 
-->echo ${string_var}--gives same output

-->echo ${#string_var}--this command is used for how many characters are present in length of the string

how to display sub string:
---------------------------
java installed or not script:
----------------------------
java -version

if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
echo "java is installed successfully"
else
echo "java is not installed"
fi

Arthamatic operations:
----------------------
we have lot of arthamatic operations 
+--> addition
- --> substraction
* --> multiplication
/ --> divison
% --> module

--> if we want to execute the arthamatic operations we need to give command called (expr)
--> this is script for arthamatics in command line arguments:


echo " this is for add"
expr $1 + $2
echo "this is for sub"
expr $1 - $2
echo "this is for multiplication"
expr $1 \* $2
echo "this is for divison"
expr $1 / $2
echo "this is for module"
expr $1 % $2

normal script
-------------
expr 2 + 3

expr 2 - 1
expr 10 \* 10
expr 10 / 2
expr 20 % 3
