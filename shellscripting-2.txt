Debug mode---> if we need to find any errors in code or dcript in debug mode we can find it
sh -x(command)  --> it will run in debug mode --- showing like command and output

I want to execute the some particular lines in debug mode in shell scripting
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
set -x--> it will start the debug mode 
set +x--> it will end the debug mode 

file name conventions--
-----------------------
--file can be minimum 255 characters as a file name 
--the name may contaion alphabates,digits,dots and underscores
--file system is case sensitive

comments--
----------
--comments are used to escape from the code
--the part of code will be ignored by the program interepter
--adding comment made things easy for the programmer, while editing the code in future


there are two types of comments
-->single line comment
it represent #
--> multi line comment
it represent <<

variables:
----------
its memory location, where we can store the data,files
 
 two types of variables in shell script:
 ---------------------------------------
 --> system defined variables (shell variables)
 --> user defined variables
 
system defined variables: these values are craeted and maintained by system 

how to check the system variables are assigned to server: command is (env,printenv)--by using this command we csn display the all system variables

SSH_CONNECTION=49.43.203.23 62171 172.31.9.155 22
LESSCLOSE=/usr/bin/lesspipe %s %s
XDG_SESSION_CLASS=user
TERM=xterm

left side indicates a variables and right side indicates values

-- if we want to display any specific system variable value --command is (echo $SHELL)

-->differnce between pwd & PWD --> pwd is command and PWD is system variable

--> by using (export) command we can change the default values (export HISTSIZE=200)

-->system variables by default it is upper case values

user defined variables:
----------------------
--> user defined values are always created with lower case
--> no spaces between variable name and value 


examples:
a=10
b=10
c=10
name=sunil

echo $a
echo $b
echo $c
echo $name




















user defined variables:
