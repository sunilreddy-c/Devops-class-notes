                        (#!)-->shebang
shell script start with (#!/bin/bash)-->it is shebang line---> by suing this line we can execute the bellow program lines.
                        -- when we didnt write shebang line in the above program it will take by default (/bash)
						--(./)--this comamnd will help to run the shell script file
