I dont want to trigger job manually
-----------------------------------
--automatically we can deploy the code in all tools 
--when the developer push the code to github
--it has three ways for that 

--Poll SCM
--Build Peridically
--github webhook

--by using above any of the process we can set automatically push the code 

Poll SCM
--------------
--started by an SCM change
--for that go through the (configue) --(build triggers) and select what ever we want , i selected a (Poll SCM)
--in that we can give a cron expression for testing purpose 
--for every one minute it is going to check the github and is there any updated code isn there, it eill trigger the poll scm
--on the basis of latest commit id 
--if commit id changes in the git hub, build trigger automatically with help of poll SCM

Build periadically
-------------------
--Started by timer
--for that go through the (configue) --(build triggers) and select what ever we want , i selected a (build perodically)
--in that we can give a cron expression for testing purpose 
--in this jenkins is not going to check the code in github, what ever it may be code is updated or not it will trigger every minute 
--in these time code will update it will automatically trigger 
--or not update it will trigger the code with latest commit id only
--

github webhook
---------------
--Started by GitHub push by sunilreddy-c
--this is used for when ever the developer updated the code and commit to repository (hit hub)
--automatically git hub intimated to jenkins there is updated code in the github
--automatically jenkins take the code and build the code .
--for that we need to go (git hub)--repository and --settings--we need to provide jenkins url --in the weebhook payloadurl(http://13.127.84.239:8080/github-webhook/)
--content type (application/json)
--while triggering a web-hook we need admin access for that repository

I need to delete old builds and maintain only a last 5 builds (Discard OLD Builds)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--if we maintain a all builds the disk usage will be increased
--all server perfomance will be decreased
--in configure tab --in general--we are selecting a (discard old builds)
--and we have options called 
1.
--Days to keep builds
if not empty, build records are only kept up to this number of days
2.
Max # of builds to keep
if not empty, only up to this number of build records are kept
in advanced section
----------------------
1.
--Days to keep artifacts
if not empty, artifacts from builds older than this number of days will be deleted, but the logs, history, reports, etc for the build will be kept
2.
Max # of builds to keep with artifacts
if not empty, only up to this number of builds have their artifacts retained

Disable this project
----------------------
--we have one option in right side , in that we have disable project
--we can click on that the project will be disabled
--disable this option we are used in when servers are outage
--

--Delete workspace before build starts
---------------------------------------
--go to project and --(click on configure )--(under build-environment)--we have option called--(Delete workspace before build starts)--we need to enable that one  --click on save
 
--Add time stamp to the console output
--------------------------------------
--go to project and --(click on configure )--(under build-environment)--we have option called--(Add time stamp to the console output)--we need to enable that one --click on save

(JACOCO-Plugin)---Java code coverage
---------------------------------------
--jaccoco generating the junit reports
