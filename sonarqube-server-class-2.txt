---after successfully installed sonaqube in server--31st video need to practice
---i want to test soanrqube for the java applications that are present in the maven server
---my sonarqube was avaliable in the another server is called sonarqube server
---now we can connect to maven server and execute a command called 
---mvn clean sonar:sonar--first sonar represent that (plugin name ) and second sonar represent that (goal name)
---if we want to run that command in maven --we need to confihure the (sonarqube url) and (user) and (password) details in  maven server
---for which application we are going need to test sonarqube for that application inside (pom.xml) file we need to configure the sonarqube url and credentials 
---

instead of providing credentials we can give token also
---------------------------------------------------------
--we can generate a token in a sonarqube (admin part) and copy that token and add in the pom.xml ---in which application we want to generate a report

--like that we can generate a sonarqube reports for all
--war applications
--jar applications
--ear applications

--in ear application we have differnet modules is there in which application means which pom.xml file we need to find a token
--in parent pom.xml file we can update a token or credentials


--if we want to  generate a sonarqube report for node.js projeect 
--for that we want to configure a (sonar.node-js )in this file we need to configure a sonarqube http url and credebtials or token 
--if we need to generate a report we want to give command called (mvn sonar:sonar) in maven server or where the project are downloaded directory

installing node.js in linux
------------------------------
--if we run the node.js project for that (npn sonar.js)
--before running this node.js project we need to install (nodejs -y)
--for that install (apt install node.js)
--for checking version of nodejs or npm
--node -v or npm -version -
