tomcat
-------
1.we build the applications by using maven build tool -jar,war,ear files
2.we build the packages by using source code 
3.now we need to run that applications, for jar files we have command by using that command we can run (java -jar jarfilename)
4.we need to run war and ear files also for that required servers

--tomcat (tomcat is an open source tool,java based, web application server)
-----------
---any of the application servers are deployed in the tomcat only 
---java application servers
---amd web logic servers
---by using tomcat server we deploy only  web applications (war files)

--jboss/wildfly
----------------
--these tools are used for only deploy the (war) and (ear) files also --enterprise application servers and web application servers


Tomcat directory structure
---------------------------
--once we download the tomcat application --after unzip there will be contain a 
--bin-- bin directory contains binary files 
--startup.sh--> this command is used to start the tomacat server in (MAC and linux)
--startup.bat--> this command is used to stsrt the tomcat server in windows

--shutdown.sh--> this command is used to stop the tomacat server in (MAC and linux)
--shutdown.sh--> this command is used to stop the tomacat server in (MAC and linux)

--catalina.sh start --> these are the shell scripts by using this shell scripts we can start and stop tomcat server in (MAC and linux)
--catalina.bat--> these are the shell scripts by using this shell scripts we can start and stop tomcat server in (windows)

--conf--conf directory contains configuration files 
--severs.xml
--tomcat-users.xml

--lib--lob directory contains libraries files
--jar files 

--logs--logs directory contains log files (by default its empty folder)
--once the files runs it will generate below files 
--catalina.out
--manager.log
--hostmanager.log
--localhost.log

--webapps- webapps directory contains web applications 
--what are the applications which we are going to deploy, those applications are stored in webapps directory (flipkart.web)
--while running the applications it will crate some files in work directory

--work--
--filpkart
--by using the directory  deployed web applications are running

--temp-- temp directory contains temparory files

tomcat installation
--------------------

pre-requtises are 
--we need to install java l.8 version--beacuse tomcat supports only java 
#Login as a root user
sudo su -

yum install wget unzip -y

cd /opt
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.95/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.95.zip
unzip apache-tomcat-9.0.94.zip
cd /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.94/bin
chmod u+x *.sh

ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.94/bin/startup.sh /usr/bin/startTomcat
ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.94/bin/shutdown.sh /usr/bin/stopTomcat
#ps -fax | grep tomcat
#netstat -tunlap
#vi /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.65/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
#Comment the below lines
#<!-- <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
# allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" /> -->
startTomcat
#stopTomcat
 
#Create a user
#vi /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.44/conf/tomcat-users.xml

once installation is done
--------------------------
--if we need to start the tomcat server we need to go to tomcat server (bin) folder  and start the server (sh startup.sh)
--instead of coming to bin directory from any where i can start the tomcat server
--for that we need  create a soft links for both start and stop tomcat in (/usr_bin directory)
--once we created soft links for both start snd stop, we can login any where from the server 
--command is (startTomcat)--for starting tomcat
             (stopTomcat)---for stopping tomcat
--if we want to know process id for tomcat server command is (ps -ef | grep Tomcat)
--its display the process id

--How to access tomcat server
-------------------------------

--go to the running server and copy public ip address (http://publicipaddress:8080)--8080 is default port number for tomcat/jenkins/jnboss/wildfly
--we are trying to open that link in browser  that will not open because --that port entery is not opened in a server

--how to open a port in server in linux server--port is nothing but entery point in the server

--need to to go server --goes to security tab--click on security rules--and click on (edit inbound rules) that will in the left side corner	--click on (add rule)--inside select (AllTcp) and ipv4 anywhere and saverules

--once adding rules now we can trying to access the link (http://publicipaddress:8080)--it will open the tomcat page in outside the server
--once app is open if we need to deploy any web application we need to click on (manager app)
--while try to open that manager app it gives error called (403 access denied)
--because tocat server is running in linux server --we are trying to open in a outside server 
--for that we need to edit the file which avaliale in (webapps) directory--this directory avaliale in apacahefile
--in (webapps) directory--we have one directory called manage --inside that we have one directory (META-INF)--inside that we have one file (context.file)
--we need to edit that file --inside that comment this lines <!-- 
                                                                <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
                                                                allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" /> 
																--> like this 
--for Host manager 
--------------------
--need to fallow above process												
				
fir creating user in tomcat
------------------------------																
--now we are going to try access now it will work and, and asking username and access
--for that we need to (conf) directory --inside that we have (tomcat users.xml) file 
--open in (vi tomcat users.xml)
--in the last we need to update one entery 
--<user username="sunil" password="Ayyaappa006" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui" />
-- password:Ayyaappa006
