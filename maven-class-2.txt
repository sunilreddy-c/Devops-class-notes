sample content in the pom.xml
------------------------------
maven --pom.xml
ant -- build.xml
gradle--build.gradle --these are the default files contaion in the tools 

interview question
------------------
---what is the default script file is avaliable in the maven ---pom.xml 
---if we want we give custom name also (flipkart.xml)

this link is used to search anything about maven--
--------------------------------------------------
https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central

--if we want that dependencies we use that dependencies easily
--in the maven repository

--(mvn package)---this command is used for package the source code 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
it will take source code from three palces 
1)maven local repo
------------------
--it is a folder in our local laptop/desktop/server..it will create when we did the first time build
--and it will create one repository in local home directory (~/.m2/repository)

--windows directory
--------------------
--in windows it will create default folder
--C:\Users\LENOVO\.m2\repository

--in linux
---------
--in linux it will create in a 
--/linux/sunil/.m2/repository

what is the maven local repository default path is ?

-- ~/.m2/repository

--if we have downlaod one maven by using one user called sunil 
--by default it will create one .m2 file in this location (/linux/sunil/.m2/repository)

--if we have downlaod one maven by using one user called anil
--by default it will create one .m2 file in this location (/linux/anil/.m2/repository)

--if we download a mutliple mavens using mutliple users, it will create no.of .m2 files 
--the useage will be increased, 
--for that we can craete one custom path for all the user in (/config) location under (settings.xml) file 
--<localRepository> here kepp the custom path</localRepository>
--

2)maven central repo
--------------------
--the central repository is the repository provided by the community.
--it contails a large repository of commonly used libraries
--the repository comes into play when maven does not find the libraries in the local repository

--each developer will have only one local repository

3)maven remote repo
---------------------
--enterprises usually maintain their own repositoryies for the libraries that are being used for the project
--this differ from the local repository , a repository is maintained on a separate server, different from the developers machines and is accesible with in the organization

mvn package :(here mvn is a command and package is a command )

mvn clean

mvn test

Maven life cycle
------------------
life cycle                                                                Goals
----------                                                         -----------------
clean                                                                   clean: it will deletes the previous build files 
site                                                                    site: it wll creates the documentation for the source code

default                                                                 validate:it will check project dirctory structure and resource file
                                                                        compile:it will compile source code and junit test cases code 
																		test:it will run the junit test cases
																		package:it will create the packages / build artifacts 
																		install:it will store the  build artifacts into maven local repo
																		deploy:it will store the build artifacts into remote repo
																		
																		interiew question: differnece b/w install gaol and deoploy goal?
																		------------------------------------------------------------------
																		
																		above all goals is important 
																		if we want to skip any goal, the only option is test goal apart test goal we dont have option to skip remaing goals
														                command is ( mvn clean package -DskipTests)
