if else conditions
------------------
--> if i need to check the condition for two numbers which one is bigger
example script of if & else condition 
echo "if and else cindition demo"
 a=100
 b=200
 
 if [ $a -gt $b ]
 then
 echo "$a is greater than $b"
 else 
 echo "$a is less than $b"
 fi
 
-->if i need to check the condition for three numbers which one is bigger
--> if we need to add more than two conditions we can use [[]] inside that we can use [[(condition && condition)]]

echo "elif cndition demo"
a=10
b=20
c=30
if [[ ( $a -gt $b ) && ( $a -gt $c ) ]]
then 
echo "$a is bigger than $b and $c"
elif [[ ( $b -gt $a ) && ( $b -gt $c ) ]]
then
echo "$b is bigger than $a and $c "
else 
echo "$c is bigger than $a and $b" 
fi

-->write a shell script to get file name from the user and check wheather that file is existed or not in the current directory?
script is:
-----------
echo "checking file present or not in the current directory"
read filename
if [ -f $filename ]
then
echo "filename is existed in the current directory"  $filename
else 
echo "file is not there" $filename
fi

-->write a shell script to get file name from the user and check wheather that file is existed or not in the current directory? if it is existed open the content of the file 
   or if it is not existed create the file 
script is
---------
   
echo "checking file present or not in the current directory"
read filename
if [ -f $filename ]
then
echo "filename is existed in the current directory"  $filename
echo "content of the file" $filename
cat $filename 
else 
echo "file is not there" $filename
echo "create the file" $filename
touch $filename
fi
write a shell script to get the file name from the user and check wheather file is having read write and execute permissions for user not ? hint (-r,-w,-x)
--> this is for write permissions
script---
----------
echo "checking the file permissions"
read filename
if [ -r $filename ]
then
echo "file have write permissions"
else
echo "file dont have write permissions"
fi

another example:
----------------
echo -n "Enter the file name    :"
read name
if test -f $name
      then
              echo "Its is a file and it has "
              if test -r $name
                     then
                           echo "Read permission "
                      fi
              if test -w $name
                     then
                           echo "Write permission "
                      fi
               if test -x $name
                     then
                           echo "Execute permission "
                      fi
else
        echo "file doesnt have all the permissions" $name

        fi

for loop condition: 5th video 50:00 min

-------------------
for (( intilization ; condition; inc/dec ))
do
...
....
done

intilization ---> intilization means creating variable and assign value to that varaiable example:a=10  ---here (a) is variable and (b) is value

example: write a shell script to numbers from one to five ?

echo "this script is forloop parctice"

for (( a=1;a<=5;a++ ))
do
echo $a
done

echo "for loop demo is done "
